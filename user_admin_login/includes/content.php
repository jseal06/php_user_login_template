    <h3>The Department of Computer Science and Information Systems</h3>
    <br/>

    <p>The Department of Computer Science and Information Systems at Birkbeck is one of the first computing departments established in the UK and we will be celebrating our 60th anniversary in 2017. We provide a stimulating teaching and research environment for both part-time and full-time students, and a friendly, inclusive space for learning, working and collaborating.
    </p>
    <p>We welcome applications from international students for full-time taught Masters and research degrees. Our postgraduate degrees are available both full-time, and part-time by flexible evening study. Our undergraduate degrees are also available part-time and full-time in central London and Birkbeck Stratford. Our students come from many different nationalities, ages and backgrounds. Situated in Bloomsbury in the heart of London, students are ideally placed to experience the capitalâ€™s places of education, culture and business. Our taught programmes emphasise the use of information technology in organisations, and aim to empower people with the technical and management skills required to succeed in a competitive market place.
